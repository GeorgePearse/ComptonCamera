GEOMETRY DEFINITION:
Geometry is defined in the B1DetectorConstruction class. The default setup is a single scattering and single absorbing detector. There is a messenger class, B1DetectorMessenger, which has a set of commands for enabling 2:1, 1:2, 2:2, 1:3, or 3:1 setups, and for changing position, rotation, and size of detectors.

PHYSICS LIST:
EMStandard_Option4 is used for this project (EMZ)

PRIMARY GENERATOR:
The primary generator is defined in the B1PrimaryGeneratorAction class. The default source is an isotropic 662 keV gamma pointsource emitting in a cone facing towards the detectors. This can be modified using the built-in G4ParticleGun class commands, or using the commands defined in the B1PrimaryGeneratorMessenger class.

DATA OUTPUT:
File writers in the B1EventAction class take data from the B1SteppingAction class and write it at the end of an event. Most of the writers are only for coincidence events, but there are some writers that output for all events (which are enabled/disabled by the coincidence parameter in the constructor of B1EventAction). There is also peak broadening to implement detector resolution based on measurements of actual detectors, which is enabled/disabled by the fPeakBroaden parameter in the constructor of B1EventAction. A data output folder can also be set using the generic messenger implemented in this class.

Some file writers are in the B1RunAction class instead, and write at the end of the entire run.

DETECTOR COMMANDS:
/B1/scat - folder for scatterer 0 commands
/B1/scat2 - folder for scatterer 1 commands
/B1/det - folder for absorber 0 commands
/B1/det2 - folder for absorber 1 commands

The following commands are available for all detectors
/setX, /setY, /setZ - set position in Cartesian coordinates (double and unit)
/setPolarR, /setPolarPhi, /setPolarTheta - set position in polar coordinates (double and unit)
/setRotX, /setRotY, /setRotZ - set rotation (double and unit)
/setRad, /setHeight - set radius and half-height of detector (double and unit)
/setMat - set detector material (string)

The following commands are only available for scatterer 1 and absorber 1
/setBool - enables/disables the detector (bool)
/setSwitch - switches the detector from a scatterer to an absorber or vice versa (bool)

Remember that /B1/update is required after any geometry changes!

PRIMARY GENERATOR COMMANDS:
/B1/source - folder for source commands

/setXPos, /setYPos, /setZPos - set position in Cartesian coordinates (double and unit)
/setSourceSize - set radius of the source (0 is a point source) (double and unit)
/setConeSource - set whether the source is a pencil beam or an isotropic cone (bool)

OTHER:
/B1/eventAction/setOutput - sets the data output folder for the event action and run action file writers
